#Team JAJA Report

This repository contains the final report for Stat 154's team JAJA, consisting of Alex Chao, Austin Carango, Jason Abdelmesieh, 
and Josh Min. 

Within code/ we have .R files corresponding to the analyses carried out by Josh and Austin and Alex and Jason. Josh's analysis
includes neural net, clustering, and PCR. Austin's contains random forest and SVM. Austin and Josh's code was used for kaggle predictions of final business ratings. Only neural net, SVM, and random forest predictions were used for kaggle. Alex and Jason's code was focused on analyzing business attributes data but was not used for kaggle. 

Within data/ we have the yelp datasets we used as well as txt files for positive and negative opinion words, which we found [here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)
(citation below). 

Finally, we have in the root directory, STAT_154_Yelp_Report_JAJA.rmd which corresponds to the report pdf we turned in to bcourses, written by Austin, Jason, and Alex.
